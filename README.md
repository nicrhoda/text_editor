  ## Description
  This application is a PWA that allows you to enter and modify text that is saved to indexed DB or local storage.  Because this is a progressive web app, it is also installable and includes a service worker so that it can be made available offline or function correctly if connection is lost.

  ## Installation
  To use this application follow this link to the deployed app on heroku: https://serene-tor-70980.herokuapp.com/

  ## Usage
  This app is meant to be used as a text editor, so once the user navigates to the site they should be able to input text that will be automatically stored in the indexed db.
